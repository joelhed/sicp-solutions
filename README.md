My work related to the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs".

The idea is that I'm going to build a Scheme interpreter in Python and use that to work on the problems in the book. As more features of the language are introduced in the book, I'll add more features to my interpreter. I will also try to improve the design of the interpreter as I learn from the book, if I can.

One Peter Norvig has made an [implementation of lisp in python](https://norvig.com/lispy.html), which I've glanced at, but I'm trying my best to implement this myself.
